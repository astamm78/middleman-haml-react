middleman-haml-react
========================

A **Middleman** skeleton using HTML 5, HAML, SASS, Twitter Bootstrap, React JS with JSX

This skeleton is using the middleman-react gem; https://github.com/plasticine/middleman-react

More information on Middleman can be found here: http://middlemanapp.com/

The React JS in this skeleton is written in Coffeescript and JSX, there's an example in the content component.

I made this skeleton to play nice with JSON API endpoints, this example uses a hard-coded JSON file in the source directory.

Setup
==================
* git clone or fork  **https://github.com/astamm78/middleman-haml-react**
* run **bundle install**
* run **middleman server**
